## Binary asset reminder

The repository keeps references to hero imagery and logistics PDFs (for example
`images/Transportation.webp` and the `pdf/route-*.pdf` files), but the binary
assets themselves are not tracked. Create or supply these files manually during
deployment so that all download links and background images function as
intended.
